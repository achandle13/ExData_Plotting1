This Readme file accompanies plot1.R, plot2.R, plot3.R, and plot4.R R scripts.

These codes produce plot1.png, plot2.png, plot3.png, and plot4.png using data from the
UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, specifically the Electric Power Consumption data set.

Each of the four scripts requires the data set to be in the working directory.  If the data set is not, 
then the scripts will error and return a message that the file is not found and should be included in the
working directory.

Each script follows the same general form:
-import Electric Power Consumption data set
-subset the data set to include observations taken only from February 1st or 2nd, 2007
-check for and remove incomplete rows, those rows containing observations with "?" as values
-create a new variable as a concatenation of the Date and Time variables and call it DateTime
-transform the DateTime variable to the form "day/month/year hour:minute:second"
-plot the data using the appropriate parameters
-save the file as PNG image

To the run the scripts using the R command line, type:
-plot1()
-plot2()
-plot3()
-plot4()
None of the functions require parameters. 

At the completion of each script a message will indicate the PNG the function generates 
is saved to working directory.
